# Ev_charging

Final Year Project | Presented at IEEE CIACON 2025
Developed a data-driven approach to optimize Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station placement using real-world data from Hyderabad. Applied K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms on features like EV density, road networks, and traffic data to identify high-demand zones and improve accessibility. The project showcased substantial gains in reducing average user travel distance and operational inefficiencies.

Presented at IEEE CIACON 2025 (International Conference on Computing, Intelligence and Application)

Compared performance of clustering models; DBSCAN achieved the most efficient coverage

Proposed a future roadmap with reinforcement learning and dynamic data integration
